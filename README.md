# HotelReservationSystem
Written Using C#, application is built for Hotel Reservations, using MultiThreading
Consider that you are creating a simplified hotel block booking system that involves hotel retailers (agencies) and wholesalers (hotel chains). The system consists of multiple travel agencies (clients), e.g., hotels.com, hotwire.com, and priceline.com, where they can book blocks of hotel rooms, and multiple hotel chains (servers), e.g., Days Inn, Holiday Inn, and Hilton, that supply blocks of hotel rooms to the agencies.
